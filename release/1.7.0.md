# 1.7.0
2/9/21

Use `.replaceAll` rather than `.replace` in `dialogConfig.js` to protect special characters during the `codeToHtml` process. Also bump default-env to version `2.3.3`. Finally, we introduce a Cloudflare cache purge to deploy more quickly to production.

## Changes
- Use `.replaceAll` in the `codeToHtml` function of `dialogConfig.js` so that special characters such as `<`, `>` and so on are handled correctly when turned into HTML.
- Use default-env `2.3.3`.
- Change `.github/workflows/main.yaml` to introduce a cloudflare cache purge 2 minutes after merging to the master branch.
